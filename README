Messaging between two peers or peer and controller:

First controller sends peers list of all peernames (sendNames):
-n|Name_of_own_Peer|IP|Port|Other_Peer|Other_Peer|...

Afterwards controller sends peers list of all neighbours (sendNTU):
Name_of_Neighbour,IP,Port,Costs|Name_of_Neighbour,IP,Port,Costs|...
Message of last peer contains a |-update at the end to start NU from there.

Peers send NU to other peers:
Own_Peer_Name~Other_Peer_Name,Cost~Other_Peer_Name,Cost~...

Peer or Controller sends message to forward:
Receiver_of_Message^Message


Structure of Readfile (read in readFile in Controller.py):

node1,ip,port|node2,ip,port|node3,ip,port|...
node1,node2,10
node2,node3,4
node3,node1,20
